# Online Computer Based Examination Software
Made using .NET Framework. 100% C#.

Progress:
  
    1. 70% done.
    2. Have the functionality to add, delete and edit:
       (a) exam packets, (b) exam questions and (c) exam takers (students).
    3. Admin can adjust time duration for each exam packets.
    4. Exam is automatically submitted when time duration ends.
    5. Database is with MySQL.
    
  TODO:
  
    1. Different languages support for exam questions.
    2. Better UI. (Sorry it sucks at the moment hehe).
    3. More memory efficient (too many frames open), I plan to stay on one frame with various tabs or panels.
    4. etc.
    
Enjoy :)
